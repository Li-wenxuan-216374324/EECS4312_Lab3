You can access the zip files through the system document picker
- Select the SysLog app to view collected log zips.

Log types supported:

* Kernel logs (dmsg)
* Last kernel log (last_kmsg, if device supports it)
* Main log (Logcat)
* Modem log
* Event logs
* SELinux audit logs

To enable access to some logs (Logcat and Radio) to SysLog, you will need to grant the READ_LOGS permision using a computer with ADB.

From a command line with adb available, you can grant the READ_LOGS permission via the following command:

adb shell pm grant com.tortel.syslog android.permission.READ_LOGS

This command tells the phone's package manager to grant the READ_LOGS permission to SysLog."

com.purplefoto.pfdock,PurpleDock,https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.purplefoto.pfdock&fdpage=45,"PurpleDock is a simple replacement for the car dock app that ships with many handsets. PurpleDock works in both Portrait and Landscape orientation. It works when connected to power and disconnected. GPS usage (used for speedometer) is throttled when not connected to power in order to save battery life.

PurpleDock allows customization of three of the launch buttons. The stickpin, headphones, and microphone buttons are pre-assigned to Google Places, Google Music, and Voice Search. To override these buttons, tap and hold for 1 second to bring up an editor. You will need to know the full name of the application and the name of the Activity to launch, which can be got from com.ideasfrombrain.search_based_launcher_v2 or or the AndroidManifest.xml of the source code of the app."
org.navitproject.navit,Navit,https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.navitproject.navit&fdpage=36,"Its modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for routing and rendering of the displayed map. It’s even possible to use multiple maps at a time. While Navit supports all major platforms, there is a fork specializing on an easy-to-use, Android-only solution: com.zoffcc.applications.zanavi.

The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination, but also generates directions and even speaks to you.

Navit currently speaks 27 languages. You can help translating via the web-based translation page."
com.zoffcc.applications.zanavi,ZANavi,https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.zoffcc.applications.zanavi&fdpage=64,"Fork of org.navitproject.navit that drops support for other platforms and solely focuses on Android. It’s designed to be ""install and start using"", so no fiddling with settings and xml files.
